## 🤔 The Goal
By harnessing the power of the current technologies we have, we can turn the voices in our heads into reality.

## ✨ Features
- 💬 Easy to Use: AI Waifu Assistant is very user-friendly, even for those who are not tech-savvy.
- 🗣️ Casual Conversations: AI Waifu Assistant is perfect for roleplaying, asking questions, or just having a casual conversation with your own waifu. You can talk to her about anything and everything under the sun!
- 🎨 Customizable Characters: With the help of vtuber-studio, you can easily create your own character and give them a unique look that matches your personality. The perfect way to give voice to your inner demons, without actually summoning them in the physical world.
- 🧩 Modular and customizable! Want to use ElevenLabs for the voice instead of Voicevox? Want to change the output language to English? Do it your way!

## 🚀 Running
Running AI Waifu Assistant is easy and straightforward! Here's how you can get started:

📌 Requirements:

- Windows 7 x64 or above.
- [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.
- [VTube Studio](https://denchisoft.com/), works on any OS both mobile and desktop.
- OpenAI API key, you can find it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
### ⚙️ Optional
- Elevenlabs key, you can find it [here](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/subscription).

📥 Running:

- First, you need to download this repository. You can do this by [clicking here](https://github.com/AlizerUncaged/desktop-waifu/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
- Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a location on your computer where you can easily find it.
- Next, you'll need to make some changes to a file called ``example.env``. This file is located in the same folder where you extracted the ZIP file. You can open it with a text editor like Notepad.
- Look for the line that says ``OPENAI_KEY`` and replace the text after the equals sign with your own OpenAI key. You'll also need to change the ``ELEVENLABS_KEY`` to yours. If you're not using Elevenlabs, you can change the ``VOICE`` variable to ``voicevox``.
- After that, you need to run a program called "VTube Studio" and enable API access. You can do this by going to the settings menu and selecting the option on the right side. Make sure the port number is set to "8001".
