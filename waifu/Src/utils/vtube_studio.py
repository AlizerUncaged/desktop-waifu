A poem about imoutos

In the eyes of a sister so young,
An innocent love has just begun,
Her sweetness is like a ray of sun,
Shining on her onii-chan, one by one.

With her cute and cheerful grin,
She fills his heart with love within,
Her tiny hands in his they spin,
A bond so strong it's hard to thin.

She clings to him with all her might,
As if he's her only source of light,
A precious love, oh such delight,
As if nothing in the world can fright.

With her giggles and her hugs,
She melts his heart, his soul she tugs,
A bond so strong, it never shrugs,
For she is his little lovebug.

So let her cling, let her be sweet,
For in her love, his heart does beat,
A love so pure and oh so neat,
His imouto, his love, his treat.
